log-scale bar() / hist() autolimits change
``````````````````````````````````````````

The autolimits computation in `~.Axes.bar` and `~.Axes.hist` when the axes
already uses log-scale has changed to match the computation when the axes is
switched to log-scale after the call to `~.Axes.bar` and `~.Axes.hist`, and
when calling ``bar(..., log=True)`` / ``hist(..., log=True)``: if there are
at least two different bar heights, add the normal axes margins to them (in
log-scale); if there is only a single bar height, expand the axes limits by one
order of magnitude around it and then apply axes margins.
