The ``gid`` is now correctly passed to svg output
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, if a figure, axis, legend or some other artists had a custom
``gid`` set (e.g. via ``.set_gid()``), this would not be reflected in
the svg output. Instead a default gid, like ``figure_1`` would be shown.
This is now fixed, such that e.g. ``fig.set_gid("myfigure")`` correctly
shows up as ``<g id="myfigure">`` in the svg file. If you relied on the
gid having the default format, you now need to make sure not to set the
``gid`` parameter of the artists.
