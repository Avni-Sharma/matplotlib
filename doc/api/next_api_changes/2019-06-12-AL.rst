API changes
```````````

The ``required_interactive_framework`` attribute of backend modules introduced
in Matplotlib 3.0 has been moved to the FigureCanvas class, in order to let it
be inherited by third-party canvas subclasses and to make it easier to know
what interactive framework is required by a canvas class.

``backend_qt4.FigureCanvasQT5``, which is an alias for
``backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT`` (but only exists under that name in
``backend_qt4``), has been removed.
